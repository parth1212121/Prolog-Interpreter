# Prolog-Interpreter
The Project is aimed at writing an Interpreter for Prolog in Ocaml.


Designed data structures to represent Prolog programs, including clauses, facts, rules, atomic formulas, and terms

Implemented unification as a parameter-passing mechanism, to resolve of goals against program clauses

Utilized a backtracking strategy to efficiently explore the resolution search space, allowing for the systematic
replacement of goals with subgoals based on unified clauses adhering to the principles of programing language
